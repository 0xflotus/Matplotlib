![No. of Flights](Flights.png)

This graph shows the total the number of flights that were on-time or delayed in the US between 2004 and 2015. From this graph, we can easily tell that most flights were on-time with an average difference of 200,000 between flights that were on-time or delayed. The data used to create this plot included all major airports across the US such as Logan International, Washington Dulles International, and John F. Kennedy International.

This bar graph shows the exchange rate for USD for some popular currencies. The x-axis provides the names of the currencies and the y-axis indicates the value of the exchange rate for $1 USD. For example, 1 USD would be equal to 1.4 AUD. The data used to create this plot included all major currencies of the world, but I chose to depidct currencies that I have used or am familiar with.[You can find the original data here!](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets)
