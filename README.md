This graph shows the total the number of flights that were on-time or elayed in the US betwwen 2004 and 2015. From this graph, we can easily tell that most flights were on-time with an average difference of 200,000 flights between those that were on-time and those that were delayed. The data used to create this plot included all major airports across the US such as Logan International, Washington Dulles International, and John F. Kennedy International.[You can find the orignal data here!](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets)
